Hi, I'm Safaraliyeva Laman, a first-year BSMath student at ADA University. I'm passionate about photography and editing, and I love using my creativity to capture and transform meaningful moments. In the future, I aspire to become a data analyst, combining my analytical skills with my curiosity for solving problems. Through this website, I hope to share my work, track my growth, and connect with others who share my interests.
