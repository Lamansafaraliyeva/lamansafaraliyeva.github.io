        <h2>How Does Hardware Work?</h2>
        <p>Project 1 was a hands-on assignment for our SITE1101 course, designed to explore the fundamentals of digital electronics and logic gate design. Our team, Group 50, consisted of four members who collaborated to design and implement basic logic gates — AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and XOR — in the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Throughout the project, we gained practical experience in understanding how hardware components process information and interact to perform logical operations. Our team worked closely with other outstanding teams — 38, 46, 77, and 83 — exchanging ideas and troubleshooting challenges to ensure the successful completion of the project. This project enhanced our understanding of the building blocks of digital systems and strengthened our skills in teamwork and experimental design.</p>

        <h2>Hour of Code</h2>
        <p>As part of our "Principles of Information Systems" course at ADA University, our four-member team organized a social project to introduce children to the fundamentals of computer science. We visited Boarding School No. 1 to teach students about algorithms in a fun and interactive way.</p>
        <p>During the session, we explained simple algorithms and logical sequences using games that made learning visual and engaging. Students also created basic "AI algorithms" and used them in a small game environment called "AI Bugs", where they could test and compete with their algorithms.</p>
        <p>This hands-on approach helped students develop logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity, while making computer science accessible and enjoyable.</p>
